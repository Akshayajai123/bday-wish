  <h2>❤️ A Note for You ❤️</h2>
  <div class="note">
    <p>Hey Chitzi! 🎉</p>

    <p>Happy Birthday!! 🥳  
    I just wanted to say a BIG thank you for always being there for me.</p>

    <p>You bring snacks and water when I ask 🍿  
    You make yummy Maggi for me (even at midnight 😴🍜).  
    That one night you woke me up for Maggi... I was angry then, but now I’m happy you did. It’s a memory I won’t forget!</p>

    <p>You even bring kadala for me from the temple during Vasantha Pooja. Thank you for that too 🥹💛</p>

    <p>And I don’t know if you remember this… maybe not, because you were sooo small 😄  
    But one day in Muvattupuzha, my water bottle went missing. We all searched everywhere.  
    And guess what? <strong>YOU</strong> found it! I still don’t know how or from where… I secretly think <em>you</em> hid it in the first place 😜  
    But no worries—I forgave you because you were a little cutie back then.</p>

    <p>Also, I miss those times when we used to sing songs together when we were small.  
    Now you only play mridangam like a big artist… but I still remember those singing days 🎶❤️</p>

    <p>I wanted to write so much more, but exams are coming, and time is short 😓  
    So this year, your birthday website is simple… but next year, be ready! I’ll show you my <strong>real</strong> website skills 😎💻</p>

    <div class="signature">
      With lots of love, <br>
      Your super sister,<br>
      <strong>Akshaya 💖</strong>
